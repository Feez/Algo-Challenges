# Fruits into Baskets (medium)
# https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview/Bn2KLlOR0lQ
# 
# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, 
# you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. 
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
#
# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. 
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
#
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
